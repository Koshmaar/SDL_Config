 TEST 007

 It loads file "test_001.cfg" (1) and saves it to "test_004.gz" (2), which is then extracted, and file that was saved there is once again 
 loaded (3), and saved to "test004_generated.cfg" (4).
 

 This test program was created with help of this tutorial: http://www.kekkai.org/roger/sdl/rwops/rwops.html

 It uses specific type of SDL_RWops stream from SDL_RWlib library (http://burningsmell.org/SDL_rwlib/) which
 allows it to load / save config file from / to .gz file. Three files that contain source of that stream are included with this test:

  - SDL_rwz.h
  - SDL_rwz.c
  - SDL_rwlib_internal.h
  
 They were modified by me slightly, since I wasn't able to compile them on VisualC++. 
 I really encourage you to download whole library, since there are implemented many other useful streams.

 Apart from that library, if you want to compile this test program and/or use SDL_RWlib in your own project,
 you'll need also to install developement version of zlib (http://www.zlib.net/).
 

 The most serious drawback of .gz files, is thay they can contain only one file.
 If you are interested in .zip files, then I have good news for you: there is Zziplib library
 (http://zziplib.sourceforge.net), which allows you to operate on .zip files.
 
 What's even better, author of Zziplib was so kind that he already created necessary SDL_RWops stream type
 for reading from .zip files (writing is not supported). See: http://zziplib.sourceforge.net/zzip-sdl-rwops.html

 Unfortunately, I wasn't able to install and compile it, so it's not tested.
 However, I have tested reading and writing to FILE stream (created using SDL_RWFromFile internally
 in SDL_config.c, when you're using plain CFG_OpenFile and CFG_SaveFile) and to .gz stream
 (SDL_RWFromGZ in this test), and they both work well. So, I would be very surprised if Zziplib didn't work.
 In theory, just change SDL_RWFromGZ to SDL_RWFromZZIP and it *should* work fine.
 
 If it works fine, that's great - mail to me that it's working. If not, also mail me that there's bug somewhere,
 so I will try to find it :-)

 -----------------------------------------
 
 There's one little problem with file generated to test_004.gz - if you will extract it and open in
 text editor, you will see that line endings have been saved in other way than with '\n' as in Windows.
 Compare file from inside test_004.gz with test_004_generated.cfg to see what I mean.
 Problem is related with that you can't pass only "w" to write to file in non-binary way.
 I don't know how to fix it by myself, sot if you know what to do it (or know any good workaround) - mail me.
