<div id=Content><div class="CFile"><div class=CTopic id=MainTopic><h1 class=CTitle><a name="Technical_stuff"></a>Technical stuff</h1><div class=CBody><p>If you&rsquo;re programmer who likes to have complete control over his programs, you may wonder what lies within SDL_Config.&nbsp; Having the knowledge of some of the intricancies allows you to understand it better and utilize this knowledge when writing your programs.&nbsp; Also, it&rsquo;s easier in event you want to change something - all in all, it&rsquo;s open source, you&rsquo;re free to do it.</p><p>Though the library has C like interface, underneath &ldquo;modern&rdquo; C++ is used exclusively.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Memory management</h4><p>Throwing version of new() is used in few places.&nbsp; No mallocs() etc. anywhere.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Strings</h4><p>std::string is used inside, though it&rsquo;s hidden by macrodefiniton, since library was designed with unicode in mind.&nbsp; Theoretically, you should be able to change std::string to std::wstring (+ couple of other minor changes) and everything should work.&nbsp; However, there are always problems with stuff like this, and I&rsquo;m not an expert on unicode, so don&rsquo;t count on my word.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Containers</h4><p>STL maps and vectors are used extensively.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Exceptions</h4><p>Enabled though not used explicitely-no <b>try</b> ing and no <b>catch</b> ing on my part.&nbsp; If something from STL throws anything, it means there&rsquo;s no memory and application would die anyway.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re concerned about it, just catch std::exception etc.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Multithreading</h4><p>There&rsquo;s nothing done to enable multithreading, no mutexes, no semaphores, no nothing.&nbsp; I suspect that when sharing one CFG_File, calling two functions that operate on it from different threads can make horrible mess, so if you want to use SDL_Config in different threads-all in your hands, write your own wrapper (preferably over ConfigFile) or change the library itself.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Known bugs</h4><ul><li>Multithreaded Debug DLL in Visaul C++ has bug(?) and doesn&rsquo;t allow text output by fprintf(stderr), which works in Multithreaded Release DLL (what is counter intuitive, since debug should be more verbose, not release)</li></ul></div></div></div>
