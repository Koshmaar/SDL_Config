<div id=Content><div class="CFile"><div class=CTopic id=MainTopic><h1 class=CTitle><a name="Description_of_configurartion_files_syntax"></a>Description of configurartion files syntax</h1><div class=CBody><h4 class=CHeading>0.&nbsp; General information</h4><h4 class=CHeading>0.1 White spaces</h4><p>SDL_Config recognizes as white spaces only <b>spaces</b> (ASCII: 32) and <b>vertical tabs</b> (ASCII: 9).&nbsp; Newline in C/C++ <b>is</b> whitespace, however, in SDL_Config it isn&rsquo;t - so ie. your group definitions can&rsquo;t break in the middle, and continue in the next line.&nbsp; This applies generally to whole library: groups, entries and comments - parser treats all lines independently, it doesn&rsquo;t remember what was before (with the sole excepetion of multiline comments).</p><h4 class=CHeading>0.2 Symbols</h4><p>Because SDL_Config can be configured by user to meet his own aesthethic tastes (ie. change operators), all paragraphs here take this into account and this convention is used: first, you will see default value (character), and next comes symbol in <b>bold</b> (or the other way around, first symbol, next value).&nbsp; Ie, &ldquo; is default value of <b>syntax_double_quote</b>, so if you want to change &ldquo; to other character, you should interest yourself with <a href="SDL_config_lib-h.html#CFG_Settings" class=LClass id=link1 onMouseOver="ShowTip(event, 'tt1', 'link1')" onMouseOut="HideTip('tt1')">CFG_Settings</a>.</p><p>All such symbols can be changed to any <b>reasonable</b> character.&nbsp; What does it mean, <b>reasonable</b>?&nbsp; Generally speaking, use common sense ;-) try to think what could cause ambiguity for parser, and avoid such situations.&nbsp; For example, setting &lsquo;a&rsquo; as <b>syntax_group_start</b> wouldn&rsquo;t be very wise.&nbsp; See <a href="SDL_config_lib-h.html#CFG_Settings" class=LClass id=link2 onMouseOver="ShowTip(event, 'tt1', 'link2')" onMouseOut="HideTip('tt1')">CFG_Settings</a> documentation for some good examples of alternative chars.&nbsp; Also, when you will encounter symbol for the first time in this article, there should be short description what you can&rsquo;t use.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Defaults</h4><ul><li>remove_group_spaces - true</li><li>syntax_group_start - [</li><li>syntax_group_end - ]</li><li>syntax_entry_equals - =</li><li>syntax_multiple_value_separator - ,</li><li>syntax_double_quote - &ldquo;</li><li>syntax_escape_sequence - \</li><li>syntax_comment_1 - /</li><li>syntax_comment_2 - #</li><li>syntax_comment_3 - ;</li><li>syntax_comment_clike_1 - /</li><li>syntax_comment_clike_2 - *</li><li>substitution_start = $(</li><li>substitution_end = )</li></ul><h4 class=CHeading>1.&nbsp; Groups</h4><p>Groups are enclosed within <b>syntax_group_start</b> and <b>syntax_group_end</b> characters, which by default are: <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>.&nbsp; Group names shouldn&rsquo;t contain white spaces (because they will be removed by parser, what can mislead readers, see: <a href="SDL_config_lib-h.html#CFG_Settings.remove_group_spaces" class=LVariable id=link3 onMouseOver="ShowTip(event, 'tt2', 'link3')" onMouseOut="HideTip('tt2')">CFG_Settings::remove_group_spaces</a>).&nbsp; Other characters, such as &ldquo;, =, // aren&rsquo;t strictly forbidden, they <b>should</b> be parsed  with no problems, but I can&rsquo;t guarantee that they will be also parsed without problems by next parser versions.</p><p>To avoid potential problems, <u>I strongly suggest that in group names, you should stick to characters, from what you can create legal variable names in C/C++</u>.&nbsp; <b>Group names are case-sensitive.</b>&nbsp; There is no maximum number of chars group name can hold (you are limited only by the amount of system memory).&nbsp; By default, you musn&rsquo;t have two groups with the same name (std::map is used as a container), however if you enable <a href="SDL_config_cfg-h.html#CFG_USE_MULTIMAP" class=LMacro id=link4 onMouseOver="ShowTip(event, 'tt3', 'link4')" onMouseOut="HideTip('tt3')">CFG_USE_MULTIMAP</a>, then std::multimap will be used instead, and so you will be able to have groups with same names.&nbsp; However, the only way to access them will be possible through group iteration (<b>CFG_StartGroupIteration</b>), since normal group selecting (<b>CFG_SelectGroup</b>) will select only the first one.</p><h4 class=CHeading>1.1  Syntax</h4><blockquote><pre>(x)
(s)[(s)name(s)](s)(x)</pre></blockquote><p>where (s) is any number of white spaces, (x) is comment that will be associated with this group, <b>name</b> is the name of this group, and <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> characters indicate that it&rsquo;s group definition.</p><h4 class=CHeading>NOTE</h4><p>Paragraph 1.1 and 1.2 assume that <a href="SDL_config_lib-h.html#CFG_Settings.remove_group_spaces" class=LVariable id=link5 onMouseOver="ShowTip(event, 'tt2', 'link5')" onMouseOut="HideTip('tt2')">CFG_Settings::remove_group_spaces</a> is enabled, as by default.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s not, then spaces inside <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> won&rsquo;t be removed.</p><h4 class=CHeading>1.2 Examples</h4><blockquote><pre>Line: [abra_kadabra]
Result: *abra_kadabra* is group name

Line: [       abra_kadabra     ]
Result: *abra_kadabra* is group name (spaces were removed by parser)

Line: [ abra    kad   abr   a ]
Result: *abrakadabra* is group name (spaces were removed by parser)

Line: [ ANOTHER_GOOD_LINE_EXAMPLE ]    ;  first good comment example
Result: *ANOTHER_GOOD_LINE_EXAMPLE* is group name and *first good comment example* is its comment

Line: [ THIS_IS
Line:  _BAD ]
Result: error, group name must begin and end in one line. If you have debugging support enabled,
        you will get &quot;couldn't classify this line&quot; error.

Line: // This group contains informations about cute little white furry bunnies
Line: [CuteLittleWhiteFurryBunnies] # yup, that's what it is
Result: *CuteLittleWhiteFurryBunnies* is group name, *This group contains informations about cute little white furry bunnies*
         and *yup, that's what it is* are comments</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>2.&nbsp; Entries</h4><h4 class=CHeading>2.1 Important general information</h4><p>Since std::map container is used internally to keep all entries regardless of their type, <b>you can&rsquo;t have two entries with same name</b>, either of same or different type!&nbsp; However, if such situation will occur, only first one will be parsed.</p><p>All entries (regardless of their type) should have key name that conforms to the same standard, as groups.&nbsp; That is: <u>you should stick to characters, from what you can create legal variable names in C/C++</u>.&nbsp; <b>Entry names are case-sensitive.</b>&nbsp; There is no maximum number of chars entry name can hold (you are limited only by the amount of system memory).</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.2.1 Text entry</h4><p>String values beginning or ending with spaces, containing spaces, <b>syntax_double_quote</b> or SDL_Config-like comments, must be enclosed in <b>syntax_double_quote</b>, (which is by default: &ldquo;, ASCII: 34).&nbsp; Also, read paragraph 3. about <b>Escape sequences</b>.&nbsp; Otherwise, you might write your string entries without them (like it&rsquo;s typically done in Windows .ini files), but for maximum security and compatibility, I recommend to stick with qoutes around.</p><p>There is no maximum number of chars string can hold (you are limited only by the amount of system memory) as long as you store it in one line.&nbsp; Enclosing double quotes will be automatically removed during parsing, and automatically added while saving.&nbsp; So, if you read player_name entry from example below using <b>CFG_ReadText</b>, you&rsquo;ll get Sharik, not &ldquo;Sharik&rdquo;.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.2.2 Syntax</h4><blockquote><pre>(x)
(s)key(s)=(s)&quot;value&quot;(s)(x)</pre></blockquote><p>where (s) is any number of white spaces (see paragraph 0.1), (x) is comment, <b>key</b> is entry identifier, and <b>value</b> is its value.&nbsp; Double quotes characters (&ldquo;) are optional (read 2.2.1 to know when you don&rsquo;t need to use them) and can be changed to other character by changing <b>syntax_double_quote</b> (read paragraph 0.2).</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.2.3 Examples</h4><blockquote><pre>Line: player_name=&quot;Sharik&quot;
Result: *player_name* is the name of this text entry, and *Sharik* is its value

Line:       player_name        =                         &quot;Sharik&quot;//this is player name
Result: *player_name* is the name of this text entry, *Sharik* is its value and *this is player name* is comment

Line: ; this shouldn't be changed by end user manually
Line: very_important_text = &quot;bleblebleblebleble&quot; # yup, that must stay as it is
Result: *very_important_text* is the name of this text entry, *bleblebleblebleble* is its value,
         and both  *this shouldn't be changed by end user manually* and *yup, that must stay as it is* are comments

Line: quote = &quot;\&quot;To be or not to be\&quot; said Macbeth&quot; // 2B || !2B
Result: *quote* is the name of this text entry, *&quot;To be or not to be&quot; said Macbeth* is its value and *2B || !2B* is comment
       shows how to embed double qutes in text entries.</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.1 Integer entry</h4><p>Entries that contain only digits (that is: characters 0..9) and optionally minus &lsquo;-&rsquo; at the beginning of value, are classified as integers.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.2 Syntax</h4><blockquote><pre>(x)
(s)key(s)=(s)value(s)(x)</pre></blockquote><p>It is identical to Text syntax, except the fact, that integer shouldn&rsquo;t be surrounded by &ldquo;, or it will be interpreted as text entry (what sometimes may be useful, ie. when you are using 64 bit numbers that are far bigger than max. allowed 32 signed integer).</p><h4 class=CHeading>In integer entry you can store 32 bit signed integers in range (brackets [] means its inclusive)</h4><blockquote><pre>[ -2147483648 .. 2147483647 ]</pre></blockquote><p>If your value don&rsquo;t fit inside, then it can&rsquo;t be stored in Sint32, so you should change type to text (by adding &ldquo; around value).&nbsp; If you won&rsquo;t do it, then this situation will be automatically detected during parsing, and entry type will be changed to text without notifying you (unless you have <b>CFG_DEBUG</b> defined, but even then it&rsquo;s gonna by only entry in log).&nbsp; Downside of this automatic type-conversion, is that your integers may unexpectedly become texts, so when reading them as integers, you&rsquo;ll get default values.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.3 Examples</h4><blockquote><pre>Line: lives = 3
Result: *lives* is the name of this integer entry, and *3* is its value

Line: enemy_count = 747
Result: *enemy_count* is the name of this integer entry, and *747* is its value

Line: IQ = 72 ; that's probably Forrest Gump
Result: *IQ* is the name of this integer entry, *72* is its value and *that's probably Forrest Gump* is comment</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>2.4.1 Float entry</h4><p>Entries that contain exactly one decimal point <b>.</b>&nbsp; (ASCII: 46), only digits (that is: characters 0..9) and optionally minus &lsquo;-&rsquo; at the beginning of value, are classified as floating point values.&nbsp; You should be careful with zero: 0 is interpreted as int entry, so you must write it as 0.0 if you want it be interpreted as float.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.2 Syntax</h4><blockquote><pre>(x)
(s)key(s)=(s)value(s)(x)</pre></blockquote><p>It is identical to Text syntax, except the fact, that that value shouldn&rsquo;t be surrounded by &ldquo;, or it will be interpreted as text entry.&nbsp; Also, there is requirment for <b>exactly</b> one decimal point inside.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.3 Examples</h4><blockquote><pre>Line: PI = 3.14
Result: *PI* is the name of this floating point entry, and *3.14* is its value

Line: money = 455.05
Result: *money* is the name of this floating point entry, and *455.05* is its value

Line: // that's probably Koshmaar
Line: IQ = -220.5 # that's false
Result: *IQ* is the name of this floating point entry, *-220* is its value and both
        *that's probably Koshmaar* and *that's false* are comments</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>2.4.1 Boolean entry</h4><p>Entries which value equals: <b>true</b>, <b>yes</b>, <b>on</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>no</b> or <b>off</b> are classified as boolean values.&nbsp; Obviously, when asked about value inside program, three first values will return <b>true</b> in C++ (or <b>1</b> in C), while three last will return <b>false</b> in C++ (or <b>0</b> in C).&nbsp; If your really want, you may change true/false etc. keywords: see <a href="SDL_config_cfg-h.html#CFG_REDEFINE_BOOL_KEYWORDS" class=LMacro id=link6 onMouseOver="ShowTip(event, 'tt4', 'link6')" onMouseOut="HideTip('tt4')">CFG_REDEFINE_BOOL_KEYWORDS</a>.</p><p>Boolean values aren&rsquo;t case-sensitive, so <b>true</b>, <b>TRUE</b> and <b>TrUe</b> will be interpreted as the same.&nbsp; If you want to use <b>yes</b>, <b>off</b> etc. for some of your text entry values, just remember to surround them with double quotes to avoid ambiguity for parser.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.2 Syntax</h4><blockquote><pre>(x)
(s)key(s)=(s)true|yes|on|false|no|off(s)(x)</pre></blockquote><p>It is identical to Text syntax, except the fact, that that value shouldn&rsquo;t be surrounded by &ldquo;, or it will be interpreted as text entry.</p><h4 class=CHeading>2.3.3 Examples</h4><blockquote><pre>Line: fullscreen = true
Result: *fullscreen* is the name of this boolean entry, and *true* is its value

Line: tank_factory = off
Result: *tank_factory* is the name of this boolean entry, and *off* is its value

Line: // following line is false
Line: true = false # this line is true
Result: *true* is the name of this boolean entry, *false* is its value and both *following line is false*
        and *this line is true* are comments</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>3.&nbsp; Escape sequences</h4><p>The only one absolutely needed by SDL_Config parser escape sequence, is <b>\&rdquo;</b> (or, more generally: <b>\syntax_escape_sequence</b>) which should be used when you want to have double quotes character inside text entry.&nbsp; You can freely use or not use other escape sequences in <b>text</b>, they&rsquo;re not interpreted, so after displaying in console value of entry which in .cfg file equals &ldquo;Bruno\n&rdquo; you won&rsquo;t get newline at the end.</p><p>Every \&rdquo; found in text entry&rsquo;s value <u>during parsing</u>, will be replaced by &ldquo;.&nbsp; Every &ldquo; found in text entry&rsquo;s value <u>during saving</u>, will be replaced by \&rdquo;.&nbsp; Usually you don&rsquo;t need to worry about any of theese, it&rsquo;s all auto-magic.</p><h4 class=CHeading>If you want to describe path on a Windows HDD, don&rsquo;t do it like this</h4><blockquote><pre>path_1 = &quot;C:\Games\MyGame\&quot;</pre></blockquote><p>since the <b>\&rdquo;</b> at the end won&rsquo;t be interpreted as end of string and parser will go wild.&nbsp; Use escape sequence <b>\\&rdquo;</b> instead</p><blockquote><pre>path_2 = &quot;C:\Games\MyGame\\&quot;</pre></blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s one more problem with path_2: after loading, it will be stored as <b>C:\Games\MyGame\</b> in memory, and will be saved as such, so when you are loading and saving to the same file, it will be saved as path_1, and during another load the same problem will arise.</p><p>Alternative solutions are to use / since they&rsquo;re also handled by Windows and won&rsquo;t get you in the troubles, or don&rsquo;t use quotes if the path doesn&rsquo;t have spaces inside</p><blockquote><pre>path_3 = &quot;C:/Games/MyGame/&quot;
path_4 = C:\Games\MyGame\</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>4.&nbsp; Comments</h4><p>Comments that stand before group or entry definitions, will be bound to those groups / entries.&nbsp; Also, if comment and group / entry is separated by blank lines, they will be bound together just as they would stay close to each other:</p><blockquote><pre>Line: // comment
Line: entry = 123</pre></blockquote><p>is the same as</p><blockquote><pre>Line: // comment
Line:
Line:
Line: entry = 123</pre></blockquote><p>Multiple single-line comments that stand one after another (without any newlines inside), will be together classified as next group / entry&rsquo;s comment.&nbsp; This rule doesn&rsquo;t apply to C like comments, even single line ones - they won&rsquo;t be grouped.</p><blockquote><pre>Line: // bla bla bla part 1
Line: // bla bla bla part 2
Line: // bla bla bla part 3
Line: [very_important_group]
Result: *very_important_group* is the name of this group and its comment are all three // comments.

Line: # serious comment 1
Line: # serious comment 2
Line: # serious comment 3
Line:
Line: entry_with = &quot;some serious comments ;-)&quot;
Result: *entry_with* is the name of this string entry, *some serious comments ;-)* is its value
        and its comment are all three # comments.

Line: /* serious comment 1 */
Line: /* serious comment 2 */
Line: /* funny comment */
Line:
Line: this_is_entry = &quot;without serious comments&quot;
Result: *this_is_entry* is the name of this string entry, *without serious comments* is its value
        and its pre comment is only /* funny comment */</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>4.1 Supported types of comments</h4><ul><li>C++ like: <b>//</b></li><li>INI file like: <b>;</b></li><li>PHP like: <b>#</b></li><li>C like: /* */</li></ul><h4 class=CHeading>4.2.&nbsp; Constrains on C like comments</h4><p>You can&rsquo;t nest them one inside another (just like in C/C++).&nbsp; Begginning and end must be in line free of entries, groups and other comments (if there are any, they will be ignored).&nbsp; Ie, those two examples are forbidden:</p><blockquote><pre>Line: /* comment */ test = 12
Line:
Line: part= yes /*
Line: inside comment
Line: */</pre></blockquote><h4 class=CHeading>5.&nbsp; Multiple value entries</h4><p>Though they are SDL_Config specific extension to ini file format, they&rsquo;re very useful.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s best to explain by example.</p><blockquote><pre>Line: totolotek = 23, 34, 21,      43,  17    ,0,1,2 // whitespaces are ignored
Line:
Line: maps = &quot;dm_kkk.map&quot;, &quot;dm_cheese.map&quot;, &quot;dm_new_bay.map&quot; // multiple value text entry
Line:
Line: cash = 555.555, 0.0, -34.34, 12345.6789 // yup, those are floats
Line:
Line: // and one last boolean multiple value entry:
Line: bools = true, false, true, no, yes, on, off</pre></blockquote><p>As you see, values are separated by commas &ldquo;,&rdquo; (<b>syntax_multiple_value_separator</b>) and whitespaces, which are ignored.&nbsp; Pre- and post- comments can be used with such entries, as usual.&nbsp; To obtain values from such entry, you use multiple value entry iteration, see: <a href="SDL_config_lib-h.html#CFG_File.CFG_StartMultiValueEntryIteration" class=LFunction id=link7 onMouseOver="ShowTip(event, 'tt5', 'link7')" onMouseOut="HideTip('tt5')">CFG_File::CFG_StartMultiValueEntryIteration</a>.&nbsp; You shouldn&rsquo;t mix entries of different types in one multi value entry, since the type of whole entry sequention is determined by first value, and following entries that differ in type are ignored.</p><p>Values inside multiple value <u>text entry</u> <b>should</b> be surrounded by <b>syntax_double_quote</b> (this rule might be liberalised later, but now it makes the implementation of parser easier).&nbsp; Note: it looks that it works even when you don&rsquo;t use <b>syntax_double_quote</b>, but this effect is pure coincidence (I didn&rsquo;t code it), so it&rsquo;s best to stick with quotes around.&nbsp; Also, remember that if you have spaces inside your text entries,  they&rsquo;ll get removed if the text values aren&rsquo;t surrounded by quotes.</p><h4 class=CHeading>6.&nbsp; Key value substitution</h4><p>Another extension to ini format.&nbsp; Helps when you have values that depend on other values.&nbsp; Consider this simple example</p><blockquote><pre>name = Hubert
greeting = Hello $(name), how R U?</pre></blockquote><p>My <b>name</b> will be substituted in place of $(name), so when reading <b>greeting</b> you&rsquo;ll get <b>Hello Hubert, how R U?</b></p><p>It&rsquo;s similiar to #definitions in C++.&nbsp; You should understand how useful this can be, if not, more real life example</p><blockquote><pre>instal_dir = &quot;C:/Games/&quot;
subdir = &quot;MagicPencil/&quot;
game = &quot;MagicPencil.exe&quot;
full_exec = $(instal_dir) $(subdir) $(game) // bear in mind that whitespaces are removed during parsing

path_to_files = $(instal_dir) $(subdir) // the $(instal_dir) in comment won't be substituted
config  = $(path_to_files) config.cfg
dll = $(path_to_files) sdl_conifg.dll
(...)
// fifty other values with $(path_to_files)</pre></blockquote><p>Without key value substitution, you would have to manually edit all of those values each time $(path_to_files) changed.&nbsp; To perform substitutions, you <b>must</b> call <b>CFG_PerformValueSubstitution</b>, most likely after CFG_OpenFile() (or probably also at other times ie. after some CFG_Writes() here and there).&nbsp; You can change the $(xxx) format by tweaking <b>substitution_start</b> and <b>substitution_end</b>.</p><p>Currently you can replace values based only on values from the same group.&nbsp; More reading and more examples about key value substitution awaits in <a href="SDL_config_lib-h.html#CFG_File.CFG_PerformValueSubstitution" class=LFunction id=link8 onMouseOver="ShowTip(event, 'tt6', 'link8')" onMouseOut="HideTip('tt6')">CFG_File::CFG_PerformValueSubstitution</a>.</p></div></div></div>
