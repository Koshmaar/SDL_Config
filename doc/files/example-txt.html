// this is comment
; another comment
# and another comment
/* AND one last frickin' comment */

// you can use /* */ comments just like in C
/*

So, this is legal C - like comment
However, remember not to nest C comments one inside another

*/

// in next line we have first integer entry
integer = 123 # this is post comment to this entry, post comments are saved with all entries

// and this is pre comment to following floating point entry
float = 3.14 ; pre comments are also saved along with entries

// It is the safest way to store strings.
text = &quot;this is text, generally text entries should be enclosed with \&quot; (that is - double quotes).&quot;
// have you noticed usage of \&quot; ?
// it's the only one escape sequence that you must use (if you want to store double quotes in text entries)
// if you would use just &quot;, then text would be equal to &quot;this is text, generally text entries should be enclosed with &quot;
// so, if your strings don't have spaces inside...

// this type of text entry (without enclosing &quot;) is also supported for ini compatibility
// but if you're not forced, use double quotes!
text_unsafe = this is also text, but all spaces will be stripped from it by parser

// so, you'll end with: thisisalsotext,butallspaceswillbestrippedfromitbyparser
// as you see, it's not very usefull, but it's supported since many windows ini files store strings in this way

; that's normal bool in the next line
; if we want to have &quot;true&quot; value, we can also use: yes, on
; if we would like to have negative value, we could use: false, no, off
bool = true

; Put it another way:
; true == yes == on
; false == no == off
bool_negated = no

// ok, up to this moment all entries were written in global group
// now, let's try to change it and create new group
// ^^^ those three // comments will be treated as pre comment of following group:

[new_group] // yup, we have created new group, and this is its post comment

  // your custom groups can have entries just like global group
  // each group have its own namespace for entries,
  // so we can repeat all entries from global group and nothing bad will happen

  integer = 123
  float = 3.14
  text = &quot;this is text, generally text entries should be enclosed with \&quot; (that is - double quotes).&quot;

  // however, don't try to duplicate entries in the same namespace:
  // integer = 234 // that's illegal


[extensions]

  // SDL_Config introduces the concept of multi value entry, which comes very handy in real life, ie.

  screen_size = 640, 480
  switches = on, off, on, on, on, off
  vertex_coordinates = 32.45, -23.77, 0.321
  random_quote = &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, &quot;What's up&quot;, &quot;Hi dude&quot;, &quot;Nice to meet you&quot;, &quot;Where are you going with that gun in your hand&quot;


  // value substitutions
